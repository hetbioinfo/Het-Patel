# Identification and Classification of Fungal Adhesive and Non-Adhesive Proteins Using Machine Learning

## 🧠 Project Summary

This project presents a machine learning-based approach to classify fungal proteins into adhesive and non-adhesive categories using protein sequence features. The project combines computational biology with tools like R, CD-HIT, and WEKA to create a complete bioinformatics pipeline.

## 🧪 Skills & Tools Used

- **CD-HIT v4.8.1**: Clustering and redundancy removal.
- **R Studio**: Feature extraction (`protr`, `Peptides`, `foreign`).
- **WEKA**: Model training and evaluation.
- **Machine Learning Models**: SVM (SMO), Naive Bayes, J48, Random Forest.
- **File Formats**: FASTA, CSV, ARFF.

---

## 🛠️ Project Workflow

1. Collect 800 fungal protein sequences (200 adhesive, 600 non-adhesive).
2. Remove redundancy using CD-HIT (80% similarity threshold).
3. Extract features (AAC, APAAC, DC, TC, CTDC, CTDD, CTDT) using R.
4. Prepare `.csv` and `.arff` files for model training.
5. Train models using WEKA and evaluate using cross-validation.
6. Analyze results using metrics like AUC, MCC, Accuracy, and visualizations.

## 🏆 Results

- **Best Accuracy**: Tripeptide Composition + SMO
- **Highlight**: Dipeptide Composition + Naive Bayes also performed well.
- **Outcome**: Demonstrated strong capability of ML in fungal adhesin prediction.
